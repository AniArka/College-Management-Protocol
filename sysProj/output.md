After analyzing the student feedback responses, I summarize the overall sentiment in one word:

ðŸ˜¡

The overall sentiment is overwhelmingly negative, with students expressing frustration, dissatisfaction, and disappointment with the teacher's teaching methods, communication, and support. The majority of the feedback is critical, highlighting issues with the teacher's approach, grading, and engagement with students.

To break it down, I categorize the responses as follows:

* Negative responses: 80%
* Neutral responses: 10%
* Positive responses: 0%

Note that none of the responses express positivity or praise for the teacher's performance. The predominant sentiment is one of disappointment, dissatisfaction, and frustration, indicating a significant problem with the teacher's teaching methods and student experience.
